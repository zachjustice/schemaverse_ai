PROBLEMS
1. Ships are created on first conquered planet with default params
    Should create ships on planet with least amount of ships
    Moving ships is expensive so we might not want to make as many ships as possible
        Create initial ships
        Move excess to closest planet at highest speed
        Create more ships and repeat step 2
2. Set ships to mine after creation and reaching destination
    It might not matter whether or not a moving ship is set to mine
    Only matters if action target is within range
3. Ships should attack nearest ship
    Don't make all ships attack one ship, but spread it out
