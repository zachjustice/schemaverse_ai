PROBLEMS
1. code is pretty messy and not pythonic
    Lambdas and list expressions

2. Update action to mining after creating ship
    should be a seperate action
    should be able to pass in an array of values to update ships with

3. Moving ships mixes API and AI
    seperate it out so that we can just provide {ship:location} dict
    have a function for providing the ship:location
    have a function for using the ship:location

4. Need to keep track of where ships are going and if they overshot
    set ships to mining after reaching destination
